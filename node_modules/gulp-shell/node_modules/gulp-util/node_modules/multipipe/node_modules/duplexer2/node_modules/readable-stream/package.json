The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.\r\n\r\n**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `\"~1.0.0\"` you’ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when you’re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `\"~1.1.0\"`\r\n\r\n",
